Foodie is basic `CRUD` `MEAN` stack app which allows users to upload pictures of their favourite foods.

### Overview

I built this app to get more familiar with the initial concepts of `React` and also how to consume an API using `axios`. This app was later added to the cirriculum on the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly as it's a perfect app to learn the basic conepts and practices of a `MERN` stack application.

Since then, I have used the app as a platform to learn `Redux`. The app now uses this to handle the data in a singular global state on the front end, this is a much easier way of managing data.

### Future

In the future, I would like to build upon the `Redux` in this app and look at two libraries.

- [react-redux-form](https://github.com/davidkpiano/react-redux-form) - would make it much easier to build the form, would also handle adding and resetting form data inside state.

- [redux-persist](https://github.com/davidkpiano/react-redux-form) - takes the state of the font-end app and sets it into the local storage of the browser meaning that if a user were to lose internet connection, they would still retain some usage of the site.
